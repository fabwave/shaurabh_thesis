1. buy the entire raspberry pi set at
	https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Starter-Kit/dp/B01C6Q2GSY/ref=sr_1_2/135-5132430-7726449?ie=UTF8&qid=1494618275&sr=8-2-spons&keywords=canakit+raspberry+pi+3+starter+kit&psc=1

2. format the sd card using SDformatter

3. write raspbian jessie using Win32DiskImager

4. connect it to a monitor (with the right resolution), keyboard and mouse, through the HDMI port and USB ports respectively.

5. open a terminal and type 'ifconfig' and note down the mac address of the PI and get it registered to the network.

6. execute
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo pip install --upgrade pip
	sudo apt install libpq-dev python-dev
	sudo pip install psycopg2

7. install tightvncserver on the PI as well as your personal system from which you want to access the pi remotely.
	execute for linux:
		sudo apt-get install tightvncserver
		vncserver #to setup the password
		tightvncserver #to initialize the server; also note down the ipaddress information which will be in the form of raspberrypi:1 or :2 or so on. 
		#raspberrypi:1 is supposed to be used as IPADDRESS:1 under remote host in tightvncviewer on the user system.
		#tutorials for tighvncserver can be found on youtube easily.
	if you restart and want to setup the server again you can do it as mentioned above or use putty to login through ssh and type "tightvncserver" to initialize.

8. enable ssh and serial in the configuration window by following steps on
	http://www.instructables.com/id/Read-and-write-from-serial-port-with-Raspberry-Pi/

	simply open configuration window by typing the following command
		sudo raspi-config

9. create a directory and download and extract all the files from 
	https://github.com/ssingh23/shaurabh_thesis/tree/master/MTCAdapter-HAAS

10. Connect the raspberry pi to the HAAS machine using the cables that can be purchased through the following links:
	Null modem cable:

11. Once you connect the raspberry pi, start the tightvncserver.

12. Using the tightvncserver remote interface run final.py, server.py and data_collection.py simultaneously and endlessly. #can also create a batch file to do  the same.
